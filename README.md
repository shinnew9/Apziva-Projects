## PApziva Projects — Overview
During my time at Apziva, I worked as a Data Scientist / AI Resident, focusing on solving real-world business problems using machine learning, NLP, and LLM-based systems.
My work focused on end-to-end pipelines, spanning data exploration and modeling through to evaluation and actionable insights.

Key themes across projects:
- Real-world, industry-scale datasets
- Customer satisfaction and decision support
- Ranking and recommendation systems
- NLP, classical ML, and LLM integration
- Translating business questions into deployable ML solutions
