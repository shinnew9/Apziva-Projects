## Apziva Projects — Overview
During my time at <b>Apziva</b>, I worked as a <b>Data Scientist / AI Resident</b>, focusing on solving real-world business problems using machine learning, NLP, and LLM-based systems.
My work focused on <b>end-to-end pipelines</b>, spanning data exploration and modeling through to evaluation and the generation of actionable insights.

<b>Key themes across projects</b>
- Real-world, industry-scale datasets
- Customer satisfaction and decision support
- Ranking and recommendation systems
- NLP, classical ML, and LLM integration
- Translating business questions into deployable ML solutions

|Number|Project Title|Description|
|------|---|---|
|1|Happy Customers|Built and evaluated classification models to predict customer satisfaction using survey data, and identified key drivers influencing service quality to support business decision-making|
|2|Term Deposit Marketing|Developed data-driven targeting and segmentation strategies to reduce call volume and improve subscription rates by addressing class imbalance and evaluating multiple predictive models|
|3|Potential Talents|Designed a semantic candidate ranking system using NLP embeddings, learning-to-rank techniques, and LLM-based retrieval to match job descriptions with relevant candidate profiles|
|4|MonReader|Implemented an end-to-end OCR and text-to-speech pipeline that extracts text from image batches, filters low-confidence results, and converts content into audio for improved accessibility|
|5|Value Investor|Explored data-driven approaches to value investing by analyzing financial indicators and market signals to support long-term investment decision-making|
|6|Voice Cloning and Fake Audio Detection|Investigated techniques for voice cloning and synthetic audio detection, focusing on identifying patterns and features that distinguish real and generated speech|
|7|Sales Reinforcer|Examined reinforcement-based strategies to support sales decision-making by modeling customer interactions and optimizing engagement policies|

### 2. Term Deposit Marketing — Customer Targeting & Segmentation
#### Goal
Reduce unnecessary call volume while improving subscription rates for a term deposit marketing campaign.

#### What I Did
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE, Tomek Links, and related techniques
- Performed customer segmentation using PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and K-means clustering
- Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models
- Compared models using F1-score and ROC-AUC
- Proposed data-driven targeting strategies that reduced call volume and improved conversion rates
- Visualized results using Tableau and shared insights via a presentation video

#### Skills & Tools
- Python, scikit-learn
- Dimensionality reduction & clustering
- Model evaluation & business-oriented reporting
- Tableau
